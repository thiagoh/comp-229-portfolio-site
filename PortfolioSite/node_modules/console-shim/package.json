  "readme": "console-shim\n============\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis small shim implements or completes `window.console` on browsers which\nhave no or incomplete console support.  The goal is to be able to use the\nconsole in JavaScript applications without having to worry about JavaScript\nerrors which might occur if a browser does not provide a native console or\nhas an incomplete console implementation. \n\nIf no native console is present and an other logging facility is available\n(like [log4javascript](http://log4javascript.org/), which is currently the\nonly supported alternate logging facility) then the emulated console is\nlinked to this logging facility.  If no alternative logging facility is\nfound then a dummy console is emulated which silently ignores all logging\nattempts.\n\n\nImplemented functions\n---------------------\n\nThis section lists the actions done by this shim if a specific console\nfeature is not supported by the browser.\n\n* **log**: Linked to log4javascript if possible. Otherwise a dummy function is\n  installed to ignore logging completely.\n* **debug**: Linked to log4javascript if possible or to the log method.\n* **info**: Linked to log4javascript if possible or to the log method.\n* **warn**: Linked to log4javascript if possible or to the log method.\n* **error**: Linked to log4javascript if possible or to the log method.\n* **assert**: Full implementation which logs an error message when the assert \n  expression is false.\n* **clear**: Empty dummy function.\n* **dir**: Linked to log message. Hopefully the browser or external logging\n  facility knows how to dump objects.\n* **dirxml**: Linked to log message. Hopefully the browser or external logging\n  facility knows how to dump DOM nodes.\n* **trace**: Empty dummy function.\n* **group**: Empty dummy function.\n* **groupCollapsed**: Empty dummy function.\n* **groupEnd**: Empty dummy function.\n* **time**: Full implementation which records the current time under the\n  specified name.\n* **timeEnd**: Full implementation which calculates the difference between\n  the current time and the recorded start time and logs it.\n* **timeStamp**: Empty dummy function.\n* **profile**: Empty dummy function.\n* **profileEnd**: Empty dummy function.\n* **count**: Empty dummy function.\n* **exception**: Linked to console.error. Not exactly the same but at least\n  all parameters are logged as an error message then.\n* **table**: Full implementation. Output is not really beautiful but it\n  works.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012 Klaus Reimer <k@ailis.de>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
